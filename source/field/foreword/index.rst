Foreword
########

The field guide contains application examples organized by thematic areas. 

Each application in the field guide is organized as follows:

**What you will learn**

Introduces the learnings addressed in the application  

**Addressing a scientific and processing goal**

Provides a brief description of the thematic area addressed by the application.

**Workflow design**

Introduces the application workflow as a Directed Acyclic Graph. In some applications the workflow is very simple and made of a single node to better address the learning goals.

**Processing nodes design**

Breaks-down the workflow nodes and describes its design.

**Application integration**

Shows hows the pieces fit together: workflow and nodes as defined in the framework.

**Data preparation**

Explains how test data is managed in the Sandbox as a combination of the steps:

* Copying external data to the Sandbox local storage
* Copying data available in the platform to the Sandbox local storage
* Pre-processing the data (e.g. changing the format)

**Application testing**

Provides the guidelines on how to test the workflow nodes individually or automatically.

**Application exploitation**

Describes how to exploit the application with e.g. larger datasets.
