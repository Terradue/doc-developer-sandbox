Application Workflow
====================

Picture the workflow as a Data Pipeline.

A data pipeline is a data workflow service that helps you process and move data between different processing steps.

The processing steps are the nodes of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). 

A directed graph may be used to represent a network of processing elements; in this formulation, data enters a processing element through its incoming nodes and leaves the element through its outgoing nodes.

Below an example of a Directed Acyclic Graph depicting a classical workflow where:

* Node A will process the data coming from the workflow sources
* Node B and Node C will process the data generated by Node A
* Node D will process the data generated by Node B and Node C

  fork again

.. tip::
   Take the time to carefully think how to structure the workflow by answering the questions:
      * how many nodes do I need?
      * can the node execution be split in several tasks?
      * what will each node read as inputs?
      * what will each node write as outputs?
      * what parameters does each node need?
