Application Workflow
####################

Picture the workflow as a Data Pipeline.

A data pipeline is a data workflow service that helps you process and move data between different processing steps.

The processing steps are the nodes of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). 

A directed graph may be used to represent a network of processing elements; in this formulation, data enters a processing element through its incoming nodes and leaves the element through its outgoing nodes.

Below an example of a Directed Acyclic Graph depicting a classical workflow where:

* Node A will process the data coming from the workflow sources
* Node B and Node C will process the data generated by Node A
* Node D will process the data generated by Node B and Node C
