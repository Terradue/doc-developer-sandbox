Using GitHub
============

GitHub is a web-based hosting service for software development projects that use the Git revision control system. 

GitHub offers both paid plans for private repositories, and free accounts for open source projects.

Laboratories and GitHub organizations
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Developer Cloud Sanbox laboratories have a one-to-one relationship with GitHub organizations meaning that every laboratory has an equivalent GitHub organization.

.. INFO:: According to your plan, the GitHub organization can host private repositories

Organizing the GitHub teams
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Whithin a GitHub organization, you can organize as many teams including any number of members (typically developers).

Owners have full access to all repositories and have admin rights to the organization. 

Created teams can have several levels of priviliedges:

* Read Access: This team will be able to view and clone its repositories. 
* Write Access: This team will be able to read its repositories, as well as push to them.
* Admin Access: This team will be able to push/pull to its repositories, as well as add other collaborators to them.

.. TIP:: We recommend managing teams with a reduced number of member within a team with write access. The remaining team members with Read only access are invited to fork the repository and submit pull requests. The owners can then moderate these requests.
