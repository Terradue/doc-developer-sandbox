Application Workflow
####################

Picture the workflow as a Data Pipeline.

A data pipeline is a data workflow service that helps you process and move data between different processing steps.

The processing steps are the edges of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). 

A directed graph may be used to represent a network of processing elements; in this formulation, data enters a processing element through its incoming edges and leaves the element through its outgoing edges.

A processing element is an edge of the DAG.
